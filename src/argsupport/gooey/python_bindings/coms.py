"""
Because Gooey communicates with the host program
over stdin/out, we have to be able to differentiate what's
coming from argsupport.gooey and structured, versus what is arbitrary
junk coming from the host's own logging.

To do this, we just prefix all written by gooey with the
literal string 'gooey::'. This lets us dig through all the
noisy stdout to find just the structured Gooey data we're
after.
